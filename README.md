# Traveler-s-Guide

This webpage was developed to help travelers on their journey across country. This webpage can act as a guide to help individuals select the best airbnb when traveling across the country, along with showing the most up to date information on different entertainment options available during their stay. This is an easy interactive webpage for travelers to connect with entertainment options and Airbnb options. 
The motivation we used for making this project was related to trveling being hard enough being able to find fun things to do near places we are already staying is one less thing to worry about.
As a user I want to view a webpage that can show me  different options of entertainment in relation to possible airbnb rentals.
